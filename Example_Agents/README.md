# Example Agents Directory

This directory provides example agent implementations that utilize the Unified MCP Tool Graph. These examples demonstrate how to integrate and use the dynamic tool retrieval capabilities in different agent frameworks.

## Subdirectories

- **`Adk/`**: Contains an example agent built using the ADK (Agent Development Kit).
- **`Langgraph/`**: Contains an example agent built using LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- **`common/`**: Contains common utilities and modules shared by the example agents. This includes client-side logic for interacting with MCP servers and server-side components for managing tasks.

## Files

- **`test_a2a_client.py`**: A script for testing agent-to-agent communication or client functionality.
