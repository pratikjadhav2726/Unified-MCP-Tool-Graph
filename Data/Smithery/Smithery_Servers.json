            "description": "MCP fal.ai Image Server\n\nEffortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf.\n\n## When and Why to Use\n\nThis tool is designed for:\n- Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts without leaving their IDE.\n- Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas.\n- Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or social media.\n- AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models.\n- Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP.\n\nKey features:\n- Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters.\n- Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key.\n- Saves images locally with accessible file paths.\n- Simple configuration and robust error handling.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key\n2. Configure MCP:\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"fal-ai-image\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-fal-ai-image\"],\n         \"env\": { \"FAL_KEY\": \"YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY\" }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE.\n\n💡 Typical Workflow:\nDescribe the image you want (e.g., “generate a landscape with flying cars using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9”) and get instant results in your IDE.\n\n### 🗨️ Example Prompts\n\n- generate an image of a red apple\n- generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors\n- generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety checker on\n\nSupported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images, image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker.\n\nImages are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model IDs, see fal.ai/models.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above.\n- npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm.\n\nAdvanced: Example MCP Request/Response\n\nRequest:\n{\n  \"tool\": \"generate-image\",\n  \"args\": {\n    \"prompt\": \"A futuristic cityscape at sunset\",\n    \"model\": \"fal-ai/kolors\"\n  }\n}\n\nExample response:\n{\n  \"images\": [\n    { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image1.png\" },\n    { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image2.png\" }\n  ]\n}\n\n## 📁 Image Output Directory\n\nGenerated images are saved to your local system:\n\n- By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if available)\n- Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai.\n\nThe full file path for each image is included in the tool's response.\n\n## ⚠️ Error Handling & Troubleshooting\n\n- If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID.\n- For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai model catalog or API docs.\n- For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub.\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub.\n\n## 🔒 Security\n\n- Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai.\n- No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API.\n\n## 🛡 License\n\nMIT License © 2025 Madhusudan Kulkarni",

            "description": "# PUMP-MPC: Solana Token Creator & Manager\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for creating and managing Solana tokens on Pump.fun, integrated with Claude Desktop.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis template provides a complete solution for creating and managing Solana tokens on the Pump.fun platform using Claude AI. It leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable Claude Desktop to interact directly with the Solana blockchain through a local server.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Create Tokens**: Launch your own Solana tokens on Pump.fun with custom name, symbol, and description\n- **Buy/Sell Tokens**: Execute trades directly through Claude\n- **Token Info**: Retrieve detailed information about any Pump.fun token\n- **Account Management**: Create and manage multiple Solana accounts\n- **Balance Checking**: View SOL and token balances for your accounts\n- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude AI through MCP\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v16 or higher)\n- npm or yarn\n- Solana CLI tools (optional, for wallet generation)\n- Claude Desktop (with MCP support)\n- A Helius RPC URL (free tier available at [dev.helius.xyz](https://dev.helius.xyz/))\n- SOL for transaction fees and initial token buys\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PUMP-MPC.git\n   cd PUMP-MPC\n   ```\n\n2. Run the setup script:\n   ```\n   chmod +x setup.sh\n   ./setup.sh\n   ```\n\n   The setup script will:\n   - Install dependencies\n   - Prompt for your Helius RPC URL\n   - Offer to set up a Solana wallet\n   - Build the project\n   - Configure Claude Desktop integration\n\n3. Alternatively, perform manual setup:\n   ```\n   npm install\n   cp .env.example .env\n   # Edit .env with your Helius RPC URL\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\nEdit the `.env` file to configure:\n\n```\n# Required: Solana RPC URL from Helius\nHELIUS_RPC_URL=https://your-helius-rpc-url\n\n# Optional: Custom path for storing keypairs\nKEYS_FOLDER=\n\n# Optional: Private key for the account (if you have an existing wallet)\nPRIVATE_KEY=\n\n# Optional: X.AI API key for additional features\nXAI_API_KEY=\n\n# Optional: Solana Tracker API Key for market data\nSOLANA_TRACKER_API_KEY=\n```\n\n## Using with Claude Desktop\n\n1. Start Claude Desktop\n2. Claude will automatically detect the MCP server if configured during setup\n3. You can now ask Claude to perform token operations\n\n### Example Prompts for Claude\n\n- \"Create a new token called 'MyToken' with symbol 'MTK' and description 'My first token' with an initial buy of 0.1 SOL\"\n- \"Get information about token [mint address]\"\n- \"Buy 0.05 SOL worth of token [mint address]\"\n- \"Sell all of my [token name] tokens\"\n- \"Check my account balance\"\n- \"List all my accounts\"\n\n## Running the Server Manually\n\nIf you need to start the server manually:\n\n```\nnode build/index.js\n```\n\n## Available Commands\n\nThe MCP server exposes the following tools to Claude:\n\n- `get-token-info`: Get information about a Pump.fun token\n- `create-token`: Create a new Pump.fun token\n- `buy-token`: Buy a Pump.fun token\n- `sell-token`: Sell a Pump.fun token\n- `list-accounts`: List all accounts in the keys folder\n- `get-account-balance`: Get the SOL and token balances for an account\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- Private keys are stored locally in the `.keys` directory\n- Never share your private keys or seed phrases\n- The server operates locally and doesn't expose your keys to the internet\n- Always verify transaction details before confirming\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Claude can't connect to the server**: Ensure the server is running and properly configured in Claude Desktop\n- **Transaction errors**: Check that your account has sufficient SOL for the transaction\n- **RPC errors**: Verify your Helius RPC URL is correct and your account has not exceeded the free tier limits\n\n## Development\n\nTo modify or extend this template:\n\n1. Make changes to the TypeScript files in the `src` directory\n2. Rebuild the project with `npm run build`\n3. Restart the server\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the ISC License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun) - The Solana token platform\n- [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/mcp) - For enabling AI-blockchain integration\n- [Helius](https://helius.xyz) - For providing Solana RPC services\n",
