To setup Stack Auth, run following command: \n        ```bash\n        npx @stackframe/init-stack@2.7.25 . --no-browser \n        ```\n        This command will automaticallysetup the project with - \n        - It will add `@stackframe/stack` dependency to `package.json`\n        - It will create a `stack.ts` file in your project to setup `StackServerApp`. \n        - It will wrap the root layout with `StackProvider` and `StackTheme`\n        - It will create root Suspense boundary `app/loading.tsx` to handle loading state while Stack is fetching user data.\n        - It will also create `app/handler/[...stack]/page.tsx` file to handle auth routes like sign in, sign up, forgot password, etc.\n      4. Do not try to manually create any of these files or directories. Do not try to create SignIn, SignUp, or UserButton components manually, instead use the ones provided by `@stackframe/stack`.\n      \n      \n    ## Components Guidelines\n      - Use pre-built components from `@stackframe/stack` like `<UserButton />`, `<SignIn />`, and `<SignUp />` to quickly set up auth UI.\n      - You can also compose smaller pieces like `<OAuthButtonGroup />`, `<MagicLinkSignIn />`, and `<CredentialSignIn />` for custom flows.\n      - Example:\n        \n        ```tsx\n        import { SignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';\n        export default function Page() {\n          return <SignIn />;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    ## User Management Guidelines\n      - In Client Components, use the `useUser()` hook to retrieve the current user (it returns `null` when not signed in).\n      - Update user details using `user.update({...})` and sign out via `user.signOut()`.\n      - For pages that require a user, call `useUser({ or: \"redirect\" })` so unauthorized visitors are automatically redirected.\n    \n    ## Client Component Guidelines\n      - Client Components rely on hooks like `useUser()` and `useStackApp()`.\n      - Example:\n        \n        ```tsx\n        \"use client\";\n        import { useUser } from \"@stackframe/stack\";\n        export function MyComponent() {\n          const user = useUser();\n          return <div>{user ? `Hello, ${user.displayName}` : \"Not logged in\"}</div>;\n        }\n        ```\n      \n    ## Server Component Guidelines\n      - For Server Components, use `stackServerApp.getUser()` from your `stack.ts` file.\n      - Example:\n        \n        ```tsx\n        import { stackServerApp } from \"@/stack\";\n        export default async function ServerComponent() {\n          const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();\n          return <div>{user ? `Hello, ${user.displayName}` : \"Not logged in\"}</div>;\n        }\n        ```\n    \n    ## Page Protection Guidelines\n      - Protect pages by:\n        - Using `useUser({ or: \"redirect\" })` in Client Components.\n        - Using `await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: \"redirect\" })` in Server Components.\n        - Implementing middleware that checks for a user and redirects to `/handler/sign-in` if not found.\n      - Example middleware:\n        \n        ```tsx\n        export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n          const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();\n          if (!user) {\n            return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/handler/sign-in', request.url));\n          }\n          return NextResponse.next();\n        }\n        export const config = { matcher: '/protected/:path*' };\n        ```\n      \n      ```\n      ## Examples\n      ### Example: custom-profile-page\n      #### Task\n      Create a custom profile page that:\n      - Displays the user's avatar, display name, and email.\n      - Provides options to sign out.\n      - Uses Stack Auth components and hooks.\n      #### Response\n      ##### File: app/profile/page.tsx\n      ###### Code\n      ```tsx\n      'use client';\n      import { useUser, useStackApp, UserButton } from '@stackframe/stack';\n      export default function ProfilePage() {\n        const user = useUser({ or: \"redirect\" });\n        const app = useStackApp();\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <UserButton />\n            <h1>Welcome, {user.displayName || \"User\"}</h1>\n            <p>Email: {user.primaryEmail}</p>\n            <button onClick={() => user.signOut()}>Sign Out</button>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n      ```\n        "}]},{"qualifiedName":"exa","displayName":"Exa Search","remote":true,"iconUrl":null,"connections":[{"type":"stdio","configSchema":{"type":"object","required":["exaApiKey"],"properties":{"exaApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"The API key for the Exa AI Search server."}}},"exampleConfig":{"exaApiKey":"your-api-key-here"},"published":true,"stdioFunction":"config => ({ command: 'npx', args: ['-y', 'exa-mcp-server'], env: { EXA_API_KEY: config.exaApiKey } })"},{"type":"http","deploymentUrl":"https://server.smithery.ai/exa/mcp","configSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"exaApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"The API key for accessing the Exa Search API."}}}},{"type":"ws","deploymentUrl":"https://server.smithery.ai/exa","configSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"exaApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"The API key for accessing the Exa Search API."}}}}],"security":{"scanPassed":true},"tools":[{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web using Exa AI - performs real-time web searches and can scrape content from specific URLs.

SCHEMA Operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP):\n   - Require UNSAFE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first)\n   - Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) require additional confirmation\n   - Example:\n     CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);\n\nMIGRATION HANDLING:\nAll queries that modify the database will be automatically version controlled by the server.

Use pagination to manage large result sets\n\nRequirements:\n- At least one filter parameter is REQUIRED (tags, list_ids, folder_ids, space_ids, statuses, assignees, or date filters)\n- Pagination parameters (page, order_by, reverse) alone are not considered filters\n\nNotes:\n- Provides workspace-wide task access (unlike get_tasks which only searches in one list)\n- Returns complete task details including descriptions, assignees, custom fields, and all metadata\n- Tag filtering is especially useful for cross-list organization (e.g., \"project-x\", \"blocker\", \"needs-review\")\n- Combine multiple filters to narrow down your search scope\n- Use pagination for large result sets\n- Use the detail_level parameter to control the amount of data returned:\n  - \"summary\": Returns lightweight task data (name, status, list, tags)\n  - \"detailed\": Returns complete task data with all fields (DEFAULT if not specified)\n- Responses exceeding 50,000 tokens automatically switch to summary format to avoid hitting LLM token limits\n"},{"name":"create_list","description":"Creates a list in a ClickUp space.

detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Repeats the process until satisfied\n- Provides a correct answer\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution\n10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"}]},{"qualifiedName":"@Cyreslab-AI/shodan-mcp-server","displayName":"Shodan MCP

   # Chain of Draft (CoD): Systematic Reasoning Tool\n\n    \n⚠️ REQUIRED PARAMETERS - ALL MUST BE PROVIDED:\n1. reasoning_chain: string[] - At least one reasoning step\n2. next_step_needed: boolean - Whether another iteration is needed\n3. draft_number: number - Current draft number (≥ 1)\n4. total_drafts: number - Total planned drafts (≥ draft_number)\n\nOptional parameters only required based on context:\n- is_critique?: boolean - If true, critique_focus is required\n- critique_focus?: string - Required when is_critique=true\n- revision_instructions?: string - Recommended for revision steps\n- step_to_review?: number - Specific step index to review\n- is_final_draft?: boolean - Marks final iteration\n\n\n    ## Purpose:\n    Enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision.\n\n    Chain of Draft is an advanced reasoning tool that enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision. Unlike traditional reasoning approaches, CoD mimics the human drafting process to improve clarity, accuracy, and robustness of conclusions.\n\n    ## When to Use This Tool:\n    - **Complex Problem-Solving:** Tasks requiring detailed, multi-step analysis with high accuracy demands\n    - **Critical Reasoning:** Problems where logical flow and consistency are essential\n    - **Error-Prone Scenarios:** Questions where initial reasoning might contain mistakes or oversight\n    - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Cases benefiting from examining a problem from different angles\n    - **Self-Correction Needs:** When validation and refinement of initial thoughts are crucial\n    - **Detailed Solutions:** Tasks requiring comprehensive explanations with supporting evidence\n    - **Mathematical or Logical Puzzles:** Problems with potential for calculation errors or logical gaps\n    - **Nuanced Analysis:** Situations with subtle distinctions that might be missed in a single pass\n\n    ## Key Capabilities:\n    - **Iterative Improvement:** Systematically refines reasoning through multiple drafts\n    - **Self-Critique:** Critically examines previous reasoning to identify flaws and opportunities\n    - **Focused Revision:** Targets specific aspects of reasoning in each iteration\n    - **Perspective Flexibility:** Can adopt different analytical viewpoints during critique\n    - **Progressive Refinement:** Builds toward optimal solutions through controlled iterations\n    - **Context Preservation:** Maintains understanding across multiple drafts and revisions\n    - **Adaptable Depth:** Adjusts the number of iterations based on problem complexity\n    - **Targeted Improvements:** Addresses specific weaknesses in each revision cycle\n\n    ## Parameters Explained:\n    - **reasoning_chain:** Array of strings representing your current reasoning steps. Each element should contain a clear, complete thought that contributes to the overall analysis.\n    \n    - **next_step_needed:** Boolean flag indicating whether additional critique or revision is required. Set to true until the final, refined reasoning chain is complete.\n    \n    - **draft_number:** Integer tracking the current iteration (starting from 1). Increments with each critique or revision.\n    \n    - **total_drafts:** Estimated number of drafts needed for completion. This can be adjusted as the solution evolves.\n    \n    - **is_critique:** Boolean indicating the current mode:\n      * true = Evaluating previous reasoning\n      * false = Implementing revisions\n    \n    - **critique_focus:** (Required when is_critique=true) Specific aspect being evaluated, such as:\n      * \"logical_consistency\": Checking for contradictions or flaws in reasoning\n      * \"factual_accuracy\": Verifying correctness of facts and calculations\n      * \"completeness\": Ensuring all relevant aspects are considered\n      * \"clarity\": Evaluating how understandable the reasoning is\n      * \"relevance\": Assessing if reasoning directly addresses the problem\n    \n    - **revision_instructions:** (Required when is_critique=false) Detailed guidance for improving the reasoning based on the preceding critique.\n    \n    - **step_to_review:** (Optional) Zero-based index of the specific reasoning step being critiqued or revised. When omitted, applies to the entire chain.\n    \n    - **is_final_draft:** (Optional) Boolean indicating whether this is the final iteration of reasoning.\n\n    ## Best Practice Workflow:\n    1. **Start with Initial Draft:** Begin with your first-pass reasoning and set a reasonable total_drafts (typically 3-5).\n    \n    2. **Alternate Critique and Revision:** Use is_critique=true to evaluate reasoning, then is_critique=false to implement improvements.\n    \n    3. **Focus Each Critique:** Choose a specific critique_focus for each evaluation cycle rather than attempting to address everything at once.\n    \n    4. **Provide Detailed Revision Guidance:** Include specific, actionable revision_instructions based on each critique.\n    \n    5. **Target Specific Steps When Needed:** Use step_to_review to focus on particular reasoning steps that need improvement.\n    \n    6. **Adjust Total Drafts As Needed:** Modify total_drafts based on problem complexity and progress.\n    \n    7. **Mark Completion Appropriately:** Set next_step_needed=false only when the reasoning chain is complete and satisfactory.\n    \n    8. **Aim for Progressive Improvement:** Each iteration should measurably improve the reasoning quality.\n\n    ## Example Application:\n    - **Initial Draft:** First-pass reasoning about a complex problem\n    - **Critique #1:** Focus on logical consistency and identify contradictions\n    - **Revision #1:** Address logical flaws found in the critique\n    - **Critique #2:** Focus on completeness and identify missing considerations\n    - **Revision #2:** Incorporate overlooked aspects and strengthen reasoning\n    - **Final Critique:** Holistic review of clarity and relevance\n    - **Final Revision:** Refine presentation and ensure direct addressing of the problem\n\n    Chain of Draft is particularly effective when complex reasoning must be broken down into clear steps, analyzed from multiple perspectives, and refined through systematic critique. By mimicking the human drafting process, it produces more robust and accurate reasoning than single-pass approaches.\n"}]},{"qualifiedName":"@magarcia/mcp-server-giphy","displayName":"Giphy API

through Gemini AI.\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process powered by Google's Gemini model.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking\n- Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process\n- Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts\n- Suggests alternative approaches when relevant\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions\n\nParameters explained:\n- query: The question or problem to be analyzed\n- context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background)\n- approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional)\n- previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context\n- thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini)\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process\n- confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1)\n- alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini\n\nSession commands:\n- sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState')\n- sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands)\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context\n2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter\n3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary\n4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed\n5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini\n6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done\n7. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"}]},{"qualifiedName":"@Operative-Sh/web-agent-qa","displayName":"WebEvalAgent","remote":false,"iconUrl":null,"connections":[{"type":"stdio","configSchema":{"type":"object","required":["operativeApiKey"],"properties":{"operativeApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"OperativeAI API key for validating access to the service."}}},"published":true,"stdioFunction":"config => ({command: 'uvx', args: ['--from', 'git+https://github.com/Operative-Sh/web-eval-agent.git', 'webEvalAgent'], env: { OPERATIVE_API_KEY: config.operativeApiKey }})"},{"type":"http","deploymentUrl":"https://server.smithery.ai/@Operative-Sh/web-agent-qa/mcp","configSchema":{"type":"object","required":["operativeApiKey"],"properties":{"operativeApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"OperativeAI API key for validating access to the service."}}}},{"type":"ws","deploymentUrl":"https://server.smithery.ai/@Operative-Sh/web-agent-qa","configSchema":{"type":"object","required":["operativeApiKey"],"properties":{"operativeApiKey":{"type":"string","description":"OperativeAI API key for validating access to the service."}}}}],"security":{"scanPassed":true},"tools":[{"name":"web_app_ux_evaluator","description":"Evaluate the user experience of a web application.\n    \n    This tool allows the AI to assess the quality of user experience and interface design\n    of a web application by performing specific tasks and analyzing the interaction flow.\n    \n    Args:\n        url: Required.

retrieve the full note content by calling `read-note`.\nHere are tips to specify keywords effectively:\n\n## Use special qualifiers to narrow down results\n\nYou can use special qualifiers to get more accurate results. See the qualifiers and their usage examples:\n\n- **book**  \n  `book:Blog`: Searches for notes in the 'Blog' notebook.\n  `book:\"Desktop App\"`: Searches for notes in the 'Desktop App' notebook.\n- **bookId**\n  `bookId:kGlLniaV`: Searches for notes in the notebook ID 'book:kGlLniaV'.\n- **tag**  \n  `tag:JavaScript`: Searches for all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes).\n- **status**  \n  `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses).\n- **title**  \n  `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title.\n- **body**  \n  `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks).\n\n### Combine qualifiers\n\nYou can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more.\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.**\n\n```text\nHello tag:Issue\n```\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status**\n\n```text\nTypescript tag:Contribution status:Completed\n```\n\n## Search for text with spaces\n\nTo find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```text\n\"database associations\"\n```\n\n## Exclude text from search\n\nTo exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples:\n\n- `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase.\n- `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag.\n- `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase.\n- `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title.\n- `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'.\n\nNote that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions.\n\n**WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier.\n\n- ✅ Will work  \n  `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`\n\n- ⛔️ Won't work  \n   `-book:Backend`.

Planning and designing treatment approaches with room for revision\n- Clinical analysis that might need course correction\n- Medical problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Healthcare decisions that require a multi-step solution\n- Medical evaluations that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant medical information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as the diagnosis progresses\n- You can question or revise previous medical assessments\n- You can add more diagnostic thoughts as new information emerges\n- You can express clinical uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every medical assessment needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a clinical hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Repeats the process until a satisfactory diagnosis or treatment plan is reached\n- Provides a correct medical assessment or

of Thoughts (AoT) is a tool for solving complex problems by decomposing them into independent, reusable atomic units of thought.\nUnlike traditional sequential thinking, this tool enables more powerful problem solving by allowing atomic units of thought to form dependencies with each other.\n\nWhen to use:\n- Solving problems requiring complex reasoning\n- Generating hypotheses that need verification from multiple perspectives\n- Deriving high-confidence conclusions in scenarios where accuracy is crucial\n- Minimizing logical errors in critical tasks\n- Decision-making requiring multiple verification steps\n\nAtom types:\n- premise: Basic assumptions or given information for problem solving\n- reasoning: Logical reasoning process based on other atoms\n- hypothesis: Proposed solutions or intermediate conclusions\n- verification: Process to evaluate the validity of other atoms (especially hypotheses)\n- conclusion: Verified hypotheses or final problem solutions\n\nParameter descriptions:\n- atomId: Unique identifier for the atom (e.g., 'A1', 'H2')\n- content: Actual content of the atom\n- atomType: Type of atom (one of: premise, reasoning, hypothesis, verification, conclusion)\n- dependencies: List of IDs of other atoms this atom depends on\n- confidence: Confidence level of this atom (value between 0-1)\n- isVerified: Whether this atom has been verified\n- depth: Depth level of this atom (in the decomposition-contraction process)\n\nAdditional features:\n1. Decomposition-Contraction mechanism: \n   - Decompose atoms into smaller sub-atoms and contract back after verification\n   - startDecomposition(atomId): Start atom decomposition\n   - addToDecomposition(decompositionId, atomId): Add sub-atom to decomposition\n   - completeDecomposition(decompositionId): Complete decomposition process\n\n2. Automatic termination mechanism:\n   - Automatically terminate when reaching maximum depth or finding high-confidence conclusion\n   - getTerminationStatus(): Return termination status and reason\n   - getBestConclusion(): Return highest confidence conclusion\n\nUsage method:\n1. Understand the problem and define necessary premise atoms\n2. Create reasoning atoms based on premises\n3. Create hypothesis atoms based on reasoning\n4. Create verification atoms to verify hypotheses\n5. Derive conclusion atoms based on verified hypotheses\n6. Use atom decomposition to explore deeper when necessary\n7. Present the high-confidence conclusion atom as the final answer"},{"name":"AoT-light","description":"A lightweight version of Atom of Thoughts (AoT) designed for faster processing and quicker results.\nThis streamlined version sacrifices some depth of analysis for speed, making it ideal for time-sensitive reasoning tasks.\n\nWhen to use:\n- Quick brainstorming sessions requiring atomic thought organization\n- Time-sensitive problem solving where speed is prioritized over exhaustive analysis\n- Simpler reasoning tasks that don't require deep decomposition\n- Initial exploration before using the full AoT for deeper analysis\n- Learning or demonstration purposes where response time is important\n\nKey differences from full AoT:\n- Lower maximum depth (3 instead of 5) for faster processing\n- Simplified verification process\n- Immediate conclusion suggestion for high-confidence hypotheses\n- Reduced computational overhead and response payload\n- Optimized for speed rather than exhaustive analysis\n\nAtom types and parameters are the same as the full AoT tool."},{"name":"atomcommands","description":"A command tool to control the decomposition-contraction mechanism and automatic termination of Atom of Thoughts.\n  \nUse this tool to access advanced features of AoT:\n\n1.

Check termination status (termination_status): Check the termination status of the current AoT process\n4. Get best conclusion (best_conclusion): Get the verified conclusion with the highest confidence\n5. Change settings (set_max_depth): Change the maximum depth limit\n\nCommand descriptions:\n- command: Command to execute (decompose, complete_decomposition, termination_status, best_conclusion,
